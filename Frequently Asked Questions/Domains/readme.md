#### <a id="what-is-domain"></a>What is a domain name? 
The domain name is the root domain for your subdomain. This is the domain that will receive the email reputation from the white label. Your root domain name should match your FROM email address. For example, if you will be sending email from updates@bestdomain.com, the domain name is bestdomain.com.

#### <a id="what-is-domain"></a>Could multiple 'from' address with different sub-domains affect my deliverability?
As long as the domain name (example.com) is included in the 'from' email subdomain (example@updates.<b>example.com<b>) the deliverability should not be affected. However, when the 'from' email (updates@example2.com) domain does not match the domain name (example.com) the deliverability might be affected.
