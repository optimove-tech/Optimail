#### <a id="what-is-deliverability"></a>What is Email Deliverability?
Deliverability refers to the percentage of emails that are actually delivered to recipients’ inboxes. For obvious reasons, it is important to do everything possible to maximize your deliverability when using Optimail.

#### <a id="best-practices"></a>What are the best prectices for good email deliverability?
 - Regularly send emails to your most engaged customers (those who tend to respond to them) and to those who have specifically opted in to receive your emails.
 - Regularly cleanse your mailing list by removing bounced email addresses, [role](https://sendgrid.com/blog/role-addresses-and-their-effect-on-email-deliverability/) email addresses and addresses of users who never open your emails.
 - Learn how your template content can affect deliverability. For example, avoid using exclamation marks and currency symbols in your subject line, as well as phrases in the email body that can trigger spam filters.
 - To ensure high open and click rates during the IP warm-up period, it is highly recommended to provide Optimove with a list of your customers’ last clicked and opened events. You can also send Optimove a list of all customers who have opened or clicked emails in the past 60-90 days.
