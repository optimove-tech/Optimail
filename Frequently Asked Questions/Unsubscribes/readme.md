#### <a id="man-unsub"></a>How should I manage unsubscribed users?
It is recommended to allow Optimail to track and manage unsubscribes (using Sendgrid, Optimail’s underlying deliverability platform). This has the advantage of having an ‘Optimail Unsubscribed’ attribute in Optimove’s customer database, which can be seen in the Customer Explorer page and which can be used to define target groups and ensure more accurate results in Campaign Analysis.


#### <a id="resub"></a>Does Optimail have a re-subscribe option?
Optimail does not offer this as a built-in feature, but you can offer this to your customers as follows: Create a landing page at which a customer can re-subscribe to your email list. Once you receive an email address in this way, you will need to manually remove the address from the unsubscribers list in Sendgrid.
